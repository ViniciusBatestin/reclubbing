        <p>RE-CLUBBING IS HERE TO RE-DEFINE, RE-THINK AND RE-CYCLE THE WAY WE USED TO PARTY.</p>

        <p>GATHERING THE GROOVENESS OF TECHOUSE, THE RAWNESS OF TECHNO, THE MELODY OF HOUSE OR JUST SIMPLY THE KYNKINESS OF SOME ACID BEATS, ALWAYS DANCING FROM THE OLD SCHOOL, BUT VIBBING ALONG WITH THE CONTEMPORANY TIMES WE LIVE IN.</p>

        <p>THIS CONCEPT IS BORN AND RAISED IN BARCELONA, AND YOU CAN FIND US IN THE NEAREST DANCEFLOOR WITH THE DIRTIEST SMILE ON THE FACE</p>
